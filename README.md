Understanding SOLID Principles
The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that help developers create scalable, maintainable, and robust software. Here's a quick overview:

1. S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
  A class should have only one reason to change.
  Each class should do one thing and do it well.

2. O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
  Software entities (classes, methods, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
  Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

4. I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
  Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
  Prefer many small, specific interfaces over a single large one.

5. D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
